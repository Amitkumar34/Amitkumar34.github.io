        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"><h3> I will add proper details later.</h3>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational
        methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners
         can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or 
         acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.</p>
